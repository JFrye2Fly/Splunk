# Splunk
Using Splunk to discover Fraud events by Age, Category, Gender, Merchant and Category


## Introduction

In this project I use Splunk in a job simulation with CommonWealth bank to discover fraudulent events by age, category, gender, merchant, category and a combination of those.

The pictures below are the queries used and the visualizations. <br> <br>

<h4>This query lists fraudlent events by category </h4>

<h4>This query lists fraudlent events by gender and category, essentially it finds which gender had the highest fraudlent events for each category and lists them in descending order</h4>

<h4>This query lists fraudlent events by age and merchant, essentially it finds age had the highest fraudlent events for a certain merchant. "Head 1" causes it to only display the top result.

## Conclusion

Splunk queries can be a lot more sophisticated but these queries prove my fundamental understanding of using queries and creating dashboards so that 
everyone can see and understand the data easily.
