# Splunk

## Introduction

In this project I use Splunk in a job simulation with CommonWealth bank to discover fraudulent events by age, category, gender, merchant, category and a combination of those.

The pictures below are the queries used and the visualizations.

Splunk queries can be a lot more sophisticated but these queries prove my fundamental understanding of using queries and creating dashboards so that 
everyone can see and understand the data easily.
